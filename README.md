# TP_baseline_coupling

### All data and code required to reproduce main analyses and most figures for the manuscript 'Euphotic zone nitrogen recycling couples ecosystem trophic structure and amino acid proxies for δ15N of primary production in paleoceanographic archives" by authors Genevieve Pugsley, Matthew McCarthy, Kimberly Delong, Ana Christina Ravelo, Thomas Guilderson and Yuan Shen, as submitted to Global Biogeochemical Cycles in February 2025. 

### Code is provided in the Jupyter Notebook File: TP_baseline_analysis_wdict.ipynb

### Datasets required to run the code are provided in the Datasets folder. Below is a brief description of each file in the Datasets folder:
1. **paleo_observations.xlsx:** includes observational data from ten amino acid nitrogen isotope paleoceanographic records from across the Pacific Ocean. Please see README worksheet/tab in the 'paleo_observations.xlsx' excel file for more information on each dataset, including links and references to original published works and archived datasets. 

2. **dataset-768655_global-model-nitrate-d15n__v1.csv:** Includes d15N of NO3 estimates from the artificial neural network climatology of Rafter et al., 2019. Original reference: Rafter, P. A., Bagnell, A., Marconi, D., & DeVries, T. (2019). Global trends in marine nitrate N isotopes from observations and a neural network-based climatology. Biogeosciences, 16(13), 2617–2633. https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2617-2019. This dataset was accessed from: https://doi.org/10.1575/1912/bco-dmo.768655.1.

3. **Nowickietal2022_eratio.nc:** Includes export ratio estimates from the data-assimilative carbon export biogeochemical model of Nowicki et al., 2022. Original reference: Nowicki, M., DeVries, T., & Siegel, D. A. (2022). Quantifying the Carbon Export and Sequestration Pathways of the Ocean’s Biological Carbon Pump.
