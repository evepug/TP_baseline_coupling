# TP_baseline_coupling
All data and code required to reproduce main analyses and most figures for the manuscript 'Euphotic zone nitrogen recycling couples ecosystem trophic structure and amino acid proxies for Î´15N of primary production in paleoceanographic archives" by authors Genevieve Pugsley, Matthew McCarthy, Kimberly Delong, Ana Christina Ravelo, Thomas Guilderson and Yuan Shen, as submitted to Global Biogeochemical Cycles in February 2025. 

Code is provided in the Jupyter Notebook File: TP_baseline_analysis_wdict.ipynb

Datasets required to run the code are provided in the Datasets folder. Within the Datasets folder, the file 'paleo_observations.xlsx' includes observational data from ten amino acid nitrogen isotope paleoceanographic records from across the Pacific Ocean. Please see README tab in this excel file for more information on each dataset, including links and references to original published works and archived datasets. 

To run the code and reproduce the manuscript figures, download the whole repository and run all code cells.
